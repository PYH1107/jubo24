# Mental abnormal detection for NN project

POC: [Shen Chiang](shenchiang@jubo.health)

NN's care team will record her mental score over time. Currently, they are
interest in the abnormalty of her mental status during day time, sleep time and
specific acitivities. Hence, this service was built to provide such features.
While changing NN's status (from awake to sleep or from sleep to awake), this
API should be called. By providing the status and time (status start and end),
this service will check her mantal status during that period and compare it
with past record to detect if it is an outlier.
