# Activity recommendation for NN project
POC: [Shen Chiang](mailto:shenchiang@jubo.health)

This API will return the predicted activity by an AI model for NN's project. 
Currently, the NN care team used an app to fill in what activity NN is 
taking at a specific time. However, there are numerous of activities in 
option, which cause care giver spending too much time to find the wanted 
one. Hence, this service was built in aim to solve this issue. The propose 
solution was train an AI model to predict what activity NN is taking at a 
given time, and recommend the top few possibilities to the users.

## Features
- By providing required information, the predicted activities will be 
  returned.
- The model will check itself training date, and update it if needed.


## Usage
- This service was built with the FastAPI framework. For detail usage 
  please refer to the online doc generated by the framework.
